# i18next-compose

![NPM Package Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/i18next-compose?color=519ea9)

A lightweight library to manage translations with **component interpolation** and **complex translation strings**

## Motivation

Translation is rarely just an engineering concern—it often involves multiple teams:

- **Developers** implement the system.
- **Translators** provide the content.
- **Designers** ensure proper rendering.
- **Product** Owners/Managers validate results.
- **Content** Writers refine copy.

i18next-compose provides a modular and efficient way to keep everyone aligned, without enforcing global `$t` helpers.

---

Built with a generic **core** package and framework-specific renderers for **Vue** and **React**.

::: tip Why?
Translations often involve developers, translators, designers, and product owners.  
This library keeps everyone aligned by making complex translations easier to manage.
